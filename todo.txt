sources of bugs:
	html does not match TS. To minimise, reduce variables in html and put them into TS


timesheet:
	style nav bar


	dialogue:
		ts, html files and folder
		modal html
		component
			initialised with function to call if OK clicked
			
	re-structure folders


	

then:
	enter transaction
	enter invoice
	enter timesheet
	Bank accounts
	import bank transactions
	p and l
	balance sheet


	escape key to close modal


Later when tools have matured and I know a lot more
	when http returns to component, browser is updated by return values
	hide navbar options when not logged in or entity not chosen
	change password inputs disappear after a wrong current password is submitted
