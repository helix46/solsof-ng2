sources of bugs:
	html does not match TS. To minimise, reduce variables in html and put them into TS

forms:... all changing with next rc
	foundation: 
		<form>, 
		<label for, 
		<input type="text" , 
		<select required>
			<option ></option>
		</select>
		<button type="submit", 
		</form>
	bootstrap css: container, form-group, form-control
	binding to model:
		<select>
			<option *ngFor="#p of powers" [value]="p">{{p}}</option>
		</select>
		where powers is an array of objects

		<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="model.name" >
		where model is the object, name is the property

		<select [(ngModel)]="model.power" >
			<option *ngFor="#p of powers" [value]="p">{{p}}</option>
		</select>
		where model is the object, power is the property

	Track change-state and validity with ngControl:
		Angular registers controls under their ngControl names with the NgForm
		<input type="text" ngControl="ngCtrlName" >
		NgControl updates the control with three classes that reflect the state.
			ng-touched	ng-untouched
			ng-dirty	ng-pristine
			ng-valid	ng-invalid


timesheet:
	style nav bar
	re-structure folders
	wait for angular2 to implement arraybuffer in http so that pdf's can be displayed
		https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/api/http/Response-class.html
		https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/f2c7946cca76ab0013970b9cb013db928072fecb/modules/angular2/src/http/static_request.ts



	

then:
	enter transaction
	enter invoice
	enter timesheet
	Bank accounts
	import bank transactions
	p and l
	balance sheet


	escape key to close modal


Later when tools have matured and I know a lot more
	when http returns to component, browser is updated by return values
	hide navbar options when not logged in or entity not chosen
	change password inputs disappear after a wrong current password is submitted



change modal
