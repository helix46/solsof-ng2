technicals needed: modal popup

then:
	transactions
	enter transaction
	invoices
	enter invoice
	timesheets
	enter timesheet
	Bank accounts
	import bank transactions
	p and l
	balance sheet




Later when tools have matured and I know a lot more
	when http returns to component, browser is updated by return values
	look out for navbar
	hide navbar options when not logged in or entity not chosen
	change password inputs disappear after a wrong current password is submitted

	bootstrap navbar mobile button won't collapse without jquery plugin
	work around:
